Financial derivatives form a significant part of the trading world, with options being one of the most commonly traded types. In this repository, I have endeavored to investigate Persian options on the Imami Gold Coin.

There is a rich array of computational and theoretical methods and approaches for pricing and trading options. I have attempted to work on some of these methods and approaches in this repository.

I have created a Python file containing the most common stochastic calculus models for pricing options. Additionally, I have crawled the following websites to gather data:

https://www.tgju.org/ (Historical Imami Gold Coin Price)
https://www.ime.co.ir/ (Historical Imami Gold Coin Options Data)
Furthermore, I have created a notebook named "ML and Statistical Models for Persian Option Trading". There, I used Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Statistical Models for forecasting the price in the future (from the current time to the option's expiration date). After backtesting all of them, I selected the best model and, based on its forecasting, traded options to calculate the performance of this approach.

Future Work:

I will use the above methods to estimate the parameters in stochastic calculus models, such as volatility. By replacing them with those models, I will attempt to price options and finally backtest to measure the performance of this method.
I will attempt to use informative features of options to apply learning and statistical models directly to the options data and investigate their performance.
I plan to combine all of the above approaches to find a robust and high-performance solution for pricing and trading Persian Financial Options.
